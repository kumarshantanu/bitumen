/**
 * <h3>Springer Dependency-Injection Support</h3>
 *
 * Springer DI's support is built on the fundamental abstraction {@link net.sf.bitumen.di.IComponentSource}. It is used in the
 * dependency map in {@link net.sf.bitumen.di.DependencyBuilder} so as to resolve transitive dependencies and form components.
 * The {@link net.sf.bitumen.di.DI} class has a bunch of static utility methods to create various kinds of component sources.
